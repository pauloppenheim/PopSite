PopSite
===========================================================================

Really natty static page generator. I wrote this for my blog a while back and called it blog.sh. Described it here https://pauloppenheim.com/blog/2018-10-24.restarting_a_blog_of_sorts.html

you may notice uhhhh it's not different than that yet. YET i mean come on, sorta defeats to purpose, developing it out? I sorta wanted to use it for more than building that dir, so i wanted to move it to another place so I could symlink it into my bin dir. So it's a standalone thing now, and it can improve independently of my blog dir.

usage:

```
popsite build_page_from_slug index
```

(assuming an `index.md` in the dir that makes sense, and a `header.chunk.html` and a `footer.chunk.html`.)

yeah that's sorta it. run with no args for help.

this is not really for consumption by others than me, outside of polite conversation?
